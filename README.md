# Advance MERN STACK Employee Management System

This is me Muzammil Ahmed Khan, a youtuber at Code Vise. I have started a series of complete advance mern stack employee management system or an advance CRUD system.

Today is Day 3 of continuing this series. We daily try to improve a lot. We try to improve our logic our content and everything that we are weak in.

The primary language of this course is Urdu and Hindi, and our targeted audience is from India and Pakistan.

## Technology Used

As you know we are going to create it using MERN Stack, so with that we are going to use multiple other technologies and features to improvise our project. The list follows as:

### Backend Technology

- Node JS
- Express JS
- MongoDB
- Cookie Parser
- BcryptJS
- JsonWebToken
- Multer
- Cloudinary

### Frontend Technology

- React JS
- Redux Toolkit
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router DOM
- React Toastify
- React Icons

## API Testing

For API Testing we are going to use `Insomnia API Testing Software`.

This is my recommendation and my opinion only. If you feel comfortable with any other tool then you could also go with that also.

### Alternative to `Insomnia`

- Postman
- Bruno

## Day 1

![Day 1](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbt8yugrw/image/upload/v1721462848/pzksl47rcgjoh8igdws9.jpg)

At day 1, we had setup a test api and set the end point to test the api and api's connection.

## Day 2

![Day 2](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbt8yugrw/image/upload/v1721462824/xhworpi6nircmwlcycrw.jpg)

At day 2, we created an error middleware to deal with errors and had created a working Sign Up and Login API and had stored the data in the MongoDB database.

At Day 2, we had just done part 1 of Authentication.

## Day 3

![Day 3](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbt8yugrw/image/upload/v1721462862/u9gluam5g7d3pweu3zhm.png)

At Day 3, we have completed our authentication and had setup cookie based authentication.

For that purpose we have used jsonwebtoken.

## Day 4

![Day 4](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbt8yugrw/image/upload/v1721720874/ooo1bim5lagcixbhhizt.png)

Today, at Day 4, we have made a middleware to verify the token created by jsonwebtoken at the time of authentication. In addition, we have also created an update profile API.
